What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

What is Kubernetes Deployment?
A Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that manages a set of identical pods (i.e., running containers). It handles the creation, update, and scaling of pods automatically, ensuring your application runs reliably and consistently.

  Think of it like this:
  A Deployment tells Kubernetes:
  What container image to use
  How many copies (replicas) to run
  What to do if a pod crashes or needs an update

What is deployment strategy?
A deployment strategy in Kubernetes defines how your application gets updated when you make changes — like a new container image or config update — without affecting availability.

Type of deployment strategy 
1. Recreate
2. Rolling update
3. Blue Green 
4. Canary
5. Progressive Delivery
6. A/B Testing
7. Shadow

1. Recreate - All old pods are stopped, then new ones are created.
2. Rolling Update - Pods are updated gradually, one or more at a time
   First pods are created and then old pods are deleted
3. Blue-Green - Two environments: Blue (old version) and Green (new version).
   Traffic is switched from Blue → Green once Green is ready.
4. Canary - Releases the new version to a small subset of users/pods (e.g., 10%).
   Monitors performance/health.
   If successful, rollout continues to more users.
5. Progressive Delivery - Umbrella strategy (includes Canary, A/B, Blue-Green).
   Uses tools like Argo Rollouts, Flagger, or Spinnaker to:
   Gradually release features
   Use traffic shifting
   Automatically pause/roll back based on metrics
6. A/B Testing - Two versions (A and B) are served to different groups of users.
7. Shadow - New version gets live traffic copies, but doesn't respond to users.
   Used for observing behavior, performance, or logging.

| Strategy             | Downtime | Rollback Ease | Risk Level  | Use Case Example                      | Production     |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |----------------|
| Recreate             | ❌ Yes    | ✅ Easy        | 🔴 High     | Simple apps, dev environments      |    No          |
| Rolling Update       | ✅ No     | ✅ Medium      | 🟡 Medium   | Web apps needing zero downtime     |    Yes         |
| Blue-Green           | ✅ No     | ✅ Very Easy   | 🟢 Low      | Critical systems with quick switch |    yes         |
| Canary               | ✅ No     | ✅ Easy        | 🟢 Low      | Gradual rollout with monitoring    |    yes         |
| Progressive Delivery | ✅ No     | ✅ Automated   | 🟢 Very Low | Large scale, monitored releases    |    yes         |
| A/B Testing          | ✅ No     | ❌ Complex     | 🟡 Medium   | User research/testing              |    no          |
| Shadow               | ✅ No     | ✅ Safe        | 🟢 Very Low | Pre-production observation         |    no          |
